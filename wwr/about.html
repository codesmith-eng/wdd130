            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The company was founded by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who shared a passion for
                adventure, teamwork, and the natural beauty of rivers. What started as a small
                rafting operation with a few rafts and local guides quickly
                grew as more people discovered the excitement and challenge of whitewater rafting.
                From the beginning, the company focused on safety, professional training, and
                respect for the environment. Over the years, it expanded its routes, improved its
                equipment, and trained certified guides to ensure every trip was both thrilling and
                secure.
                Today, the company is known for delivering memorable rafting experiences to
                beginners and experienced rafters alike, while remaining committed to river
                conservation, community involvement, and responsible tourism.</p>
